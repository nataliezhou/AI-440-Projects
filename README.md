# Natalie's AI Machine Projects (SP23)

MP1 - Probability: Analyzes word count distributions in 500 emails from the Enron-Spam dataset.

MP2 - Naive Bayes: Creates a Naive Bayes model+LaPlace smoothing to determine pos/neg movie reviews from the Stanford Movie Review dataset.

MP3 - KNN: Employs the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to classify images as containing animals or not. 

MP4 - Neural Nets: Builds and trains neural networks based on the PyTorch framework to label animals in images.

MP5 - Search (BFS, A*): Maze-solving using BFS and A* search. 

MP6 - Minimax: Uses Minimax and alphabeta search to generate optimal move sequences in a 2-player chess game.

MP7 - Rule logic: First-order logic, unification, and backward-chaining on rule sets.

MP8 - Hidden Markov Model: Implements part of speech (POS) and Viterbi tagging using an HMM model.

MP9 - Perception: Create a full end-to-end training and testing pipeline for a CNN for the task of image classification on the standard vision dataset CIFAR10.

MP10 - Markov decision processes: Implements a value iteration algorithm on MDP models.

MP11 - Reinforcement learning: Implementation and model training of a Q-learning algorithm with exploration strategies, Q-learning updates, and saving/loading of Q and N tables to play a Pong Game.
